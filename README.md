# posib. (legacy)

> Old PHP implementation of **posib.**, a simple in-place editing CMS.

* * *

The two firsts versions of **posib.** was in PHP, running well but closed source. With the goal to rewrite **posib.** in node.js as an educational purpose, the old PHP version of **posib.** will now be open sourced.

Note that, even if the current code are running in production for many sites, it will never be documented. Feel free to test it if you want, fork or rewrite any part of it. I'm _out_ of the PHP world for so long that I can't, really, assure the maintenance of a PHP version.

The only purpose of this code is to serve as _proof of concept_, demo and base of the **posib.** CMS before rewriting it, in `node.js` with my students.
